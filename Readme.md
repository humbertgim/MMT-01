MMT-01 is (an open source?) Digital Measuring Tape for Mitersaws, band saws, etc ...

There's not much of an alternative when it comes to digitalization of the tools workers use in their shops.

The features that MMT-01 incorporates are:

Measuring accuracy of 0.1 mm
High contrast multicolor OLED display
Saw blade thickness compensation
Saw blade thickness calibration
The features that I'm working on are:

Universal clamp
Battery
Multiple units (implemented in the code, no menu to select different units)
